On this Project I built the backend, frontend and mobile app.


Backend: A RESTful API was built using Node.js, Express, Cors, etc.. 
This API was then integrated with a SQLite database using Knex.

Website: The website frontend was built using ReactJS.

Mobile App: The app was built using React Native and Expo.
